This project was built on a Cocoa-based application written in Objective C++ program that implements OpenGL APIs (Application programming interface) to create a simulation of a precessing and nutating symmetric top. Using the Euler angles to control the pitch, roll and yaw, you are able to find the energy in the system and compute the Lagrangian. Solving the Lagrangian with respect to the Euler angles and differentiating with respect to time, you are able to obtain the angular acceleration for each component. Using these equations with the Euler-Cromer Algorithm, you are able to build a simulation for the spinning top. This program uses OpenGL APIs to draw a plane and a top (inverted cone) that rests on top of the plane.
